# this is a puzzle part of game "sangokushi puzzle" created in Unity.

My first game in unity (almost my first game except snake and tetris I wrote in assembler when I was student). 
I didn't read any book or done any tutorial on unity or c# when I created this game. 
And I tried to create this game as fast as I can. I created it in 4 days. 
So, I assume there are a lot of not good style of writing (including elementary things such as 
unnecessary method variable decalration etc.,). needless to say unity project structure.
